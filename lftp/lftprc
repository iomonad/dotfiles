########## SETTINGS 

# On startup, lftp executes ~/.lftprc and ~/.lftp/rc. You can place aliases and 'set' commands 
# there. Some people prefer to see full protocol debug, use 'debug' to turn the debug on.

# Certain commands and settings take a time interval parameter. It has the format Nx[Nx...], where N is time amount
# (floating point) and x is time unit: d - days, h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default unit is second. E.g.
# 5h30m or 5.5h. Also the interval can be 'infinity', 'inf', 'never', 'forever' - it means infinite interval. E.g.
# 'sleep forever' or 'set dns:cache-expire never'.

# The name of a variable can be abbreviated unless it becomes ambiguous. The prefix before ':' can be omitted too. 
# You can set one variable several times for different closures, and thus you can get a particular settings for 
# particular state. The closure is to be specified after variable name separated with slash '/'.

# The closure for 'dns:', 'net:', 'ftp:', 'http:', 'hftp:' domain variables is currently just the host name as you
# specify it in the 'open' command (with some exceptions where closure is meaningless, e.g. dns:cache-size). For 
# some 'cmd:' domain variables the closure is current URL without path. For other variables it is not currently 
# used. See examples in the sample lftp.conf.

# Boolean settings can be one of (true, on, yes, 1, +) for a True value or one of (false, off, no, 0, -) for a False 
# value.

# There is also a system-wide startup file in /etc/lftp.conf. It can be in different directory, see FILES section.

# \w
# the current working directory at the remote site
# \W

set ftp:ssl-protect-data yes

# if true, request ssl connection for data transfer between two ftp servers in FXP mode. CPSV or SSCN command will
