# /etc/eixrc/00-eixrc
#
# All non-hidden files in /etc/eixrc
# (or a subdirectory thereof) are read in alphabetical order.
#
# In these files system-wide defaults for variables related to eix can
# be stored, i.e. the variables set in files override the built-in defaults.
# Both can be overridden by ~/.eixrc and by environment variables.
#
# It is strongly recommended to set here only those variables which you
# want to *differ* from the built-in defaults (or for which you have a
# particular reason why the default should never change with an eix update).
#
# *Otherwise you might miss changes in the defaults in newer eix versions*
# which may result in confusing behavior of the eix binaries.
#
# If you want to get a file containing the setting of all related variables
# in the current/defaults state, redirect the output of options --dump
# or --dump-defaults, respectively.
#
# However once more: To avoid unexpected problems
#
#   *IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO SET _ALL_ VARIABLES* in /etc/eixrc/*
#
# Only set those for which you have a reason to do so!
#
# For the available variables and their defaults, see the output of the
# options --dump or --dump-defaults.
# For more detailed explanations see the manpage of eix.
