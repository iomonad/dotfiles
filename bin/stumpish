StumpIsh is the StumpWM shell. Use it to interact a running StumpWM
instance.  When run from a terminal with no arguments, stumpish
accepts commands interactively and prints each result.  If standard
input is a pipe, stumpish executes any number of commands and prints
the concatenated results. If the '-e' option and one argument are
given on the command line, stumpish reads any number of lines from
standard input and uses them as the argument to the named command.
Otherwise, if one or more arguments are provided on the command line,
the first is considered the name of the command to execute and the
remainder is concatenated to form the argument.

Example:
	echo '(group-windows (current-group))' | "$0" eval
EOF
    exit 0;
}
